# OOP vs Prototypes Lab

This repository is a deliberate practice project to understand software design choices by implementing the same prompts in:

- C++ (classical object-oriented programming)
- JavaScript (prototype-based inheritance and duck typing)

The focus is on:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Composition vs inheritance tradeoffs

Each level includes a prompt, implementations in both languages, and notes on what was learned.
